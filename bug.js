The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a database reference before it's fully initialized. This often happens when you try to read or write data in a component's `componentDidMount` method before Firebase has had time to set up the connection.  This can manifest as a silent failure or a more cryptic error related to undefined references.

Example (React):
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { db } from './firebase'; // Firebase initialization

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Incorrect: Accessing db before it's ready
    db.ref('myData').once('value').then(snapshot => {
      setData(snapshot.val());
    });
  }, []);

  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</div>;
}
```
